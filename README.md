## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Run with Docker

1. Set up project settings file (check [settings.schema.yaml](../InNoHassle-Search/settings.schema.yaml) for more info).
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
   Edit `settings.yaml` according to your needs.
2. Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:—Ö
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you can find API docs on http://localhost:8004/docs. Good job!

### Run locally

1. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. Install project dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#options-2).
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```
5. Check that your `settings.yaml` looks like:
   ```yaml
   $schema: "./settings.schema.yaml"
   api_settings:
      db_url: "mongodb://mongoadmin:secret@localhost:27017/db?authSource=admin"
   minio:
      access_key: "minioadmin"
      secret_key: "password"
   ```
6. Set up a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Minio](https://min.io/) instances.

    - Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:—Ö
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Run the database instance:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d db minio
      ```
    - Make sure to set up the actual database connection in `settings.yaml`.
7. Choose the way to run models: either use Infinity or local models.
   1. If you want to use local models, just not set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml`
   2. If you want to use Infinity, set `infinity_url` in `settings.yaml` to the url of deployed Infinity engine.
      You can run Infinity engine locally:
      ```bash
      uv run --no-project --with "infinity_emb[all]" --with "transformers<4.49" infinity_emb v2 --model-id jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3 --model-id jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual
      ```
      Or use deployed Infinity engine provided by someone else.

8. Run ml client
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.ml_service
   ```
9. Run the ASGI server
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.api
   ```
   Check API docs on http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs


### PyCharm integrations

## üß™ Testing

For testing we use ```pytest```.
* To run tests enter in your terminal:
   ```
   poetry run pytest tests
   ```
* To generate test coverage report run:
   ```
   poetry run pytest  --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=src/ tests/
   ```
   You can change coverage ignored folders/files in `.coveragerc`.
