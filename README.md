## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Run with Docker

1. Set up project settings file
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
   Replace the `db_url` and `mongo_url` fields in `settings.yaml` with:
   ```bash
   "mongodb://mongoadmin:secret@db:27017/db?authSource=admin"
   ```

2. Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

3. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you can find API docs on http://localhost:8004/docs.

### Run locally

1. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. Install project dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#options-2).
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```
5. Set up project settings file
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
6. Set up a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Minio](https://min.io/) instances.

    - Set up database settings for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) container
      in `.env` file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Run the database instance:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d db minio
      ```
    - Make sure to set up the actual database connection in `settings.yaml`.
7. Choose a model runner:
   - **Local models:** leave `infinity_url` unset in `settings.yaml`

   - **Infinity engine:** set `infinity_url` to your deployed instance

   To run Infinity locally:
      ```bash
      uv run --no-project --with "infinity_emb[all]" --with "transformers<4.49" infinity_emb v2 --model-id jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3 --model-id jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual
      ```
   - Or use deployed Infinity engine provided by someone else.

8. Start the ML client
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.ml_service
   ```
9. Start the ASGI server
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.api
   ```
   Access the API docs on http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs
